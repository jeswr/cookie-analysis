  <h1>Tim Berners-Lee</h1>

  <h2><a id="Bio" name="Bio">Biography</a></h2>

  <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
    while at <a href="https://www.cern.ch/">CERN</a>, the European
    Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web
    client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and
    HTML were refined as Web technology spread.</p>
  
  <p>He is the co-founder and CTO of <a href=
  "https://inrupt.com/">Inrupt.com</a>, a tech start-up that uses,
  promotes and helps develop the open source <a href=
  "https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> platform. Solid aims to give
  people control and agency over their data, questioning many
  assumptions about how the web has to work. Solid technically is a new level
   of standard at the web layer, which adds features
  never put into the original spec, such as global single sign-on,
  universal access control, and a universal data API so that any
  app can store data in any storage place. Socially Solid is a
  movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and
  toward a world in which users are in control, and empowered by
  large amounts of data, private, shared, and public.</p>

  <p>Sir Tim is the Founder, Emeritus Director, and an Honorary Member of the Board of Directors of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, a Web standards
  organization that he founded in 1994 which develops interoperable
  technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to
  lead the Web to its full potential. He is a Director of the
  <a href="https://www.webfoundation.org/">World Wide Web
  Foundation</a> that was launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts
  to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.</p>

 
  <p>He is the Emeritus 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School
  of Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of
  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Laboratory for
  Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence ( <a href=
  "https://csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>) at the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology (<a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>) where he
  founded the <a href="https://dig.csail.mit.edu/">Decentralized
  Information Group (DIG)</a>.</p>

  <p>Research at DIG and its collaborators was the origin of what became the <a href=
  "https://solidproject.org/">Solid Platform</a>.

  <p>He is also a Professor in the <a href=
  "https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-10-27-sir-tim-berners-lee-joins-oxfords-department-computer-science">
  Computer Science Department</a>,
  and an Honorary Student at 
  <a href="https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/">Christ Church</a>, at the University of Oxford, UK.
   

  He is President of and co-founder the <a href=
  "https://theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a> in London.
</p>

  <p>In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He has been
  the recipient of several international awards including the Japan
  Prize, the Prince of Asturias Foundation Prize, the Millennium
  Technology Prize and Germany's Die Quadriga award. In 2004 he was
  knighted by H.M. Queen Elizabeth and in 2007 he was awarded the
  Order of Merit. In 2009 he was elected a foreign associate of the
  National Academy of Sciences. He is the author of "<a href=
  "https://www.w3.org/Weaving/Overview.html">Weaving the Web</a>".</p>

  <p>On March 18 2013, Sir Tim, along with Vinton Cerf, Robert
  Kahn, Louis Pouzin and Marc Andreesen, was awarded the <a href=
  "https://qeprize.org">Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering</a>
  for "ground-breaking innovation in engineering that has been of
  global benefit to humanity."</p>

  <p>On 4 April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded the&nbsp;<a href=
  "https://awards.acm.org/about/2016-turing" title=
  "turing prize">ACM A.M. Turing Prize</a> for inventing the World
  Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols
  and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Turing Prize,
  called the "Nobel Prize of Computing" is considered one of the
  most prestigious awards in Computer Science.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2022, he won the <a href="https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220928000610">Seoul Peace Prize</a> for his work promoting data sovereignty and leading the movement to “decentralize” the web dominated by tech giants.</p>

    <h2><a id="Before" name="Before">Before you mail me</a></h2>    <ul>      <li>If you need someone to find something for you about some arbitrary        subject (travel agents, or parakeets or whatever), don't ask me, but try        the <a href="https://vlib.org/">Virtual Library</a> for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a>        or your favorite search engine.</li>      <li>If you want to know how to run a server, or how to edit HTML, check        the <a href="/">W3C web</a> or your local bookstore. I'm sorry I can't        answer individual requests for help.</li>      <li>If you can't access something on <tt>www.w3.org</tt> , you find bad        links from www.w3.org pages, or errors in the hypertext please see the <a          href="../../Help/Webmaster.html">webmaster's documentation</a>..</li>      <li>If you are doing homework or a school project on the history of the        Web then please check my <a href="Kids.html">Kid's questions</a>, or        the more general <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a>; and        also, <a href="/Help/">W3C FAQ</a>, or <a href="FAQ.html">my press FAQ</a>        as almost everything I have is there or linked from this page. I am        sorry I cannot help with individual projects.</li>      <li>If you are a member of the press and need clarification or an        interview, please mail <a href="mailto:w3t-pr@w3.org">w3t-pr@w3.org</a>        (and Cc me) with details.</li>      <li>If it is about a possible speaking engagement, see <a href="#Speaking">below</a>.</li>    </ul>    <p>If you have a serious comment on things I have signed, then do email me.      I am also always open to discussion with W3C Advisory Committee      representatives.</p>    <h2>What not to email</h2>    <p>Email is safe unless it contains programs. (Data and documents are fine,      programs are not). If you send me a program, I will not run it, as it      could damage my system and could be a virus.</p>    <ul>      <li>Note: Documents for Microsoft word, Excel, and possibly other Office        programs tend to execute programs (scripts) in what you would expect to        be harmless documents. These can expose my machine to viruses, because        these programs do not (it seems) prevent scripts from running within a        document when it is received by email. Please do not send me Microsoft        Office documents.</li>      <li>If you are sending text, please send it as plain text, HTML, or PDF.        If you use your favorite word process, slide tool, etc, and send it in        that program's format, then you are forcing me install proprietary        software on whatever machine I read them on.</li>      <!==      <li>If your email is sent from Microsoft Outlook, and contains an attachment,      I will be more likely to discard it as I understand that a famous series of      viruses in 2001 resulted from Outlook's tendency to execute scripts in      email, and used up a huge amount of my and my colleague's time.</li>    </ul>    <h2>What you can email</h2>    <ul>      <li>These are all good document standards: Plain text messages, HTML        (sometimes called rich text) pages without scripts, Photos (JPEG files,        PNG, GIF and SVG), PDF, SMIL, RDF/XML, N3 and so on. All these can be        sent as messages or as attachments to messages. I can read them with a        variety of software programs, and they cannot contain viruses, unless        there is a serious bug in the code I use to read them. If you don't need        anything else, then use plain text.</li>    </ul>    <p>These are good rules when emailing anyone.</p>    <p>Please use my full name in the "To" line with my email address, as this      will make your message look less like spam. This will happen automatically      if you have me in your address book. If you just type in my email address,      I probably won't see your mail.</p>    -->
